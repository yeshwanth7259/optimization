Container Optimizer API->Porject Overview

This is a Spring Boot microservice designed for container-routing optimization.
It exposes an API endpoint (POST /pickSpot) to compute the best container move by analyzing a given yardMap.
The service calculates the lowest score spot, helping with efficient container placement in the yard.

Request Body:
{
  "yardMap": [
    [5, 8, 9],
    [4, 3, 6],
    [7, 2, 1]
  ] }

This is a JSON format where the 'yardMap' represents the container yard as a 2D array.
The algorithm will calculate the lowest score by processing each container slot.

Response Body:
{
  "row": 2,
  "column": 2,
  "score": 1
}

The response returns the optimal row, column, and score of the container yard slot.
